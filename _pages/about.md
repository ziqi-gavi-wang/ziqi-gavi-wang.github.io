I am currently a master student at [the State Key Laboratory of Robotics and Systems](http://robot.hit.edu.cn) at [Harbin Institute of Technology](https://www.hit.edu.cn) , mainly engaged in the research of exoskeleton robots and soft robots.

I earned my bachelor‚Äôs degree at [School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering](https://mae.jlu.edu.cn) at [Jilin University](https://www.jlu.edu.cn) , under the guidance of [Prof. Zhihui Zhang](https://cbae.jlu.edu.cn/info/1221/3883.htm?eqid=ce15c342000be4c00000000364413dba). Now, I am pursuing a master's degree in the research group of [Prof. Jie Zhao](https://homepage.hit.edu.cn/zhaojie), Director of the Robotics Institute of Harbin Institute of Technology, under the guidance of [Prof. Yanhe Zhu](https://homepage.hit.edu.cn/zhuyanhe).

My research interest includes preference-based optimizations of exoskeleton assistance during walking üö∂ and anti-interference soft manipulator with precise motion controller üêô . I have published 4 papers in top international journals and 2 papers in top international robotics conferences with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=uQ24fEgAAAAJ'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>50+</span></strong></a> .

[**Paper**](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10611497)
- A novel preference-based human-exoskeleton locomotion interaction experience transfer (LIET) framework, which could speed up the exploration of human-preferred parameters and acquire more satisfying results for naive wearers via the HELIE acquired from knowledgeable wearers.
- Established the mathematical expression of the HELIE transfer during exoskeleton assistance based on the proposed LIET framework.

- Through a 4D printing method to produce bioinspired hydrogel capsules for smart controlled drug release.
- The 4D printed capsules featured with PNIPAM hydrogel as the shell, and the types and doses of drugs can be freely loaded.
- Drug release profiles can be well programmed by adjusting the internal pore size of the hydrogel capsules.
- In contrast to common 4D external shape change, we used 4D printing to produce change in internal material structure.
